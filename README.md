# Official Arduino Library for databot by aRbotics, LLC

Learn about databot at https://databot.us.com

Databot is an innovative STEM education product based on the open source Arduino
platform. It is a small cube form factor, 42.5mm3, that contains 11 built in sensors for
experimentation, plus ports for expansion. This library and the sketches within it have
been designed to work “out of the box” with databot so that busy teachers can be up
and running quickly with activities for students. Databot is based on the Arduino Uno so
these libraries and sketches should work for anyone with an an Arduino Uno and the
sensors specified here if you want to build your own and modify the sketches
accordingly. We recommend shopping with Arduino, Sparkfun, and Adafruit for your
Uno, sensors, and components if you do this as we all benefit from the incredible open
source resources they have contributed to the Arduino community.

This initial release of the databot library includes the following features:

- Complete libraries and sample sketches required to conduct educational activities using
the Arduino IDE with databot or a compatible Arduino board with the appropriate
sensors.

- A set of sketches built and tested with the Android version of Google Science Journal, a
free software initiative supported by Google that enables students to create and maintain
a digital science journal capturing data from the internal smart device sensors. Using the
free databot Link Android App, available on the Google Playstore, you can now easily
connect databot or other Arduino Uno compatible projects to Google Science Journal.

This library is released to the public under the GPL3 license and can be adapted as
desired for any other purposes, including commercial use. Read the license for details.
A great deal of time, resources, and risk have been involved by all the parties involved
in developing databot. We ask that you buy databot products and recommend them to
your teacher friends to help support our continuing work!

# Getting Started
This is an Arduino library that you can download as a zip file and install manually or you
can access it and install through the Arduino IDE Library manager (recommended
method). The Arduino Library manager updates hourly so you can easily access and
install the most current version through the IDE.
